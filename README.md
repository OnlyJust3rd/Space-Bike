# Space Bike

Hi there,

This project is just a fun project I worked on when I was freed on grade 12.

The game is just normal 2D space shooting game not really interesting but the interesting part must be the arduino module that attach to it and measure the speed of the physical bike as a controller lmao.

The footage of the game -> https://youtu.be/GdeZ4mxn_4Y?si=mL4KWVQSEz3kmf6C
